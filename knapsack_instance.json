  "description": "\n# Knapsack Problem\n\n## Overview\nThis is a 0-1 knapsack problem where you need to select items to maximize total value while respecting a weight constraint.\n\n## Problem Details\n- Number of items: 20\n- Weight capacity: 500\n- Total value of all items: 932\n- Total weight of all items: 1066 (exceeds capacity by 566 units)\n- Average item value: 46.60\n- Average item weight: 53.30\n\n## Top Items by Value-to-Weight Ratio\n- Item 12 (variable x_12): Value = 64, Weight = 5, Ratio = 12.80\n- Item 0 (variable x_0): Value = 91, Weight = 8, Ratio = 11.38\n- Item 18 (variable x_18): Value = 74, Weight = 24, Ratio = 3.08\n- Item 8 (variable x_8): Value = 96, Weight = 33, Ratio = 2.91\n- Item 19 (variable x_19): Value = 87, Weight = 32, Ratio = 2.72\n\n## Optimization Goal\nChoose a subset of the 20 items to include in the knapsack such that:\n1. The total weight does not exceed 500\n2. The total value is maximized\n\n## Decision Variables\n- x_i (binary): 1 if item i is selected, 0 otherwise\n\n## Constraints\n- Sum of weights of selected items \u2264 500\n\n## Objective\n- Maximize the sum of values of selected items\n"
